To quickly get started go to “World Portal System Package”/Prefabs and drag “Portal Pair” into your scene. It’s that easy! You have now added seamlessly teleporting and visual portals to your project! 

To be able to walk through the portals you need to use the “PortalableFPSController” prefab located in the same folder. Just drag it into your scene as well.
